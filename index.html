    <h1>This Is A Fun Fun Heading</h1>
    <p id="Paragraph1">This is a paragraph.  It is <em id="italics">multiple sentences</em> that make a point. Trey loves Shrek.  He is his number one fan.  If Trey could be anyone for a day he would be Shrek.  Trey now, you're an All-Star, get your game on, go, code.  I'm really hungry, I want some spaghetti.  Does Shrek like spaghetti?  I should ask Trey if Shrek likes spaghetti.  If Trey is Shrek, then who is the donkey?</p>
    <p id="Paragraph2">Is Truett Lord Farquaad?  How far would Lord Farquaad go for a 3 Musketeers bar?  If Lord Farquaad taught Geometry, would we learn about Farquaadrilaterals?</p>
    <div><strong>No one</strong> likes CSS</div>
    <p id="donkey">
      How much would could a donkey chuck if a donkey could chuck wood.  Has donkey ever been rick rolled?  Why is the meaning of life explained so well by parfaits in Shrek?  Can Trey simultaneously be Shrek and Donkey as they represent the multiple facets of the modern man's psycho-identity?  Is the sky blue or is that some other science I don't understand because I just write code?  Adam never says anything in class, I wonder what he's thinking?  He probably has a lot of stuff on his mind, like cheeseburgers and philosophy.  I like Adam, he's a cool guy.
